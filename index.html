        <p>My name is Emily Tuttle! I took a break from school for a couple years to work and decide what I wanted to study. I worked several different jobs and have two now that I love. I work for a jeweler doing product photography and shipping and also for Flights From Home. I enjoy rock climbing, pyrography, playing piano, and roller skating.</p>
